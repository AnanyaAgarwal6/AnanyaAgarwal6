                <p>Hey, I'm Ananya Agarwal and I'm currently pursuing my B.Tech from Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering College. I have done my schooling form R.R.K Sr. Sec. School. I have a little bit of experience in UI/UX designing and learning the basics of html and css. According to me designing is the way to represent our thoughts and emotions. It makes me feel good everytime I do it. I did my first designing project for a workshop held in my college and after that I knew what I want to do in my life and I will try my best to achieve my goals.  </p>
